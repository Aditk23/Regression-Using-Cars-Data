	- Dealing missing values
	- Exploratory Data Analysis
	- Pre processing data in python
	- Normalization

2) Descriptive statistics
	- Analysis of variance
	- Correlation

3) Model Development
	-	Multiple Linear Regression

4) Model Review and Evaluation
	- Regression Plots
	- Coffecients of each variable
